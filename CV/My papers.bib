	abstract = {Disease can be a powerful driver of population and community dynamics, as well as evolutionary processes. Disease is also emerging at increasing rates, resulting in massive impacts on populations, communities, and ecosystems. However, assessing these impacts requires foundational knowledge of disease agents and hosts, which is often lacking, particularly in aquatic insects. We describe a recent disease outbreak in caddisflies, suggesting potential consequences for population and community dynamics of the host. We use a series of complementary studies to develop a cohesive foundation of information about this disease, including identification using genomic methods, observational prevalence studies, laboratory experiments to establish transmissibility and fitness consequences, and laboratory and field investigations to infer transmission mechanisms. We identified the infection as being caused by the oomycete Saprolegnia—the first time this parasite has been noted in insect eggs. Prevalence surveys found high prevalence (up to 36\%) with variation across space, time, and host species. We demonstrated increasing egg mortality with increasing infection within an egg mass (every 10\% increase in infection rate doubles odds of mortality), thereby confirming disease. We established transmissibility and show that transmission occurs through both direct contact with infected egg masses and from background sources, which probably interact to create complex patterns of disease. Taken together, our findings show that conditions necessary for population and community consequences are present. Specifically, increased mortality rates almost certainly occurred during the outbreak, yielding lower larval numbers and potentially altering community interactions. Transmission by contact between egg masses combined with observed species-specific prevalence suggest shifts in the relative performance of different species because of interactions between host and parasite life histories. Outside extreme examples such as chytrid fungus, disease has traditionally received less interest than resource competition or predation in community ecology, although disease ecology is advancing rapidly. One major hurdle is a lack of foundational knowledge characterising disease processes in natural communities, particularly in aquatic insects. Our findings highlight the importance of investigating diseases in insect eggs and provide the foundation for further investigations of how these processes play out at the population and community scale.},

We hypothesised that hydrological mechanisms in such watersheds tend to spatially segregate spawning and over-summering habitats, and tested the hypothesis using observations from a series of tributaries in a pristine watershed. Consistent with the hypothesis, reaches with suitably sized spawning gravels tended to occur in intermittent tributaries, and also the perennial mainstem (which was too warm for over-summering). In early summer, juvenile O. mykiss ({\textless} 10 cm) occurred at similar densities in the intermittent and perennial tributaries, but larger fish had greater densities in perennial tributaries. Large wood debris would be expected to mitigate the spatial segregation of habitats somewhat, but was scarce, though stream-side outcrops appeared to partially compensate by forcing gravel bars in high-gradient channels.},

	abstract = {In sexual conflict, aggressive males frequently diminish the long-term reproductive success of females in efforts to gain a short-term advantage over rival males. This short-term advantage can selectively favour high-exploitation males. However, just as the over-exploitation of resources can lead to local extinction, the over-exploitation of females in the form of harassment by aggressive males can yield similar consequences resulting in reduced female fecundity, :increased female mortality and overall decline in mating activity. This outcome may often be prevented by selection acting at multiple levels of biological organization. Directional selection favouring aggressive exploitation within groups can be balanced by directional selection amongst groups opposing exploitation. Such between-group selection has recently been demonstrated in laboratory studies of water striders, where the conditional dispersal of individuals increased variation amongst groups and influenced the balance of selection toward reduced male aggression. This multilevel selection (MLS) framework also provides predictive value when investigating natural populations differing in their relative strength of selection within versus among groups. For water striders, the consequences of local exploitation cause fitness differences between groups, favouring less aggressive males. Inconsistently flowing ephemeral streams consist of isolated pools that prevent aggressive male water striders from escaping the consequences of local exploitation. We, therefore, predicted that inconsistently flowing ephemeral streams would favour the evolution of less aggressive males than would perennial streams, which allow aggressive males to move more freely and to escape the group-level costs of their aggression. Comparing two neighbouring streams during the mating season, we found that males dispersed naturally between pools at much higher rates in the perennial stream than in the ephemeral stream. As predicted, we found that males from the perennial stream were significantly more aggressive than those from the ephemeral stream. We also found that dispersers were significantly more aggressive than non-dispersers within each stream. These field results illustrate the relevance of the MLS framework in our understanding of the evolution of sexual conflict.},

Although there is a long history of study of regional diversity as an emergent property, analyses of fully multiscale dynamics are rare. Here, we use scale transition theory for a quantitative analysis of multiscale diversity maintenance with continuous scales of dispersal and environmental variation in space and time. We develop our analysis with a model of a linear habitat, applicable to streams or coastlines, to provide a theoretical foundation for the long-standing interest in environmental variation and dispersal, including downstream drift. We find that the strength of regional coexistence is strongest when local densities and local environmental conditions are strongly correlated. Increasing dispersal and shortening environmental correlations weaken the strength of coexistence regionally and shift the dominant coexistence mechanism from fitness-density co...},

	abstract = {Stream systems are characterized by a hierarchical dendritic branching pattern, which is thought to have important consequences for stream community structure. However, branching is associated with many other changes in stream condition, which make disentangling the effects of branching from associated environmental changes challenging. Moreover, much difficulty arises in scaling up local effects of branching within a watershed to the watershed as a whole, which is where diversity is arguably maintained and management and restoration efforts are assessed. Here, we show that branching can be present with no associated changes to community dynamics, either locally or in the watershed as a whole when branching affects only dispersal patterns and not environmental structure. We explore violations of these conditions to identify how branching can modify environmental conditions affecting coexistence in the watershed. We show that the strength of coexistence in the watershed depends in all essentials on the amount of environmental heterogeneity with only a small role for other factors. Only when streams are small relative to the scales of environmental change or dispersal can branching affect the strength of watershed-scale coexistence independently of changes to environmental heterogeneity in the watershed, but these effects are small and depend on interactions with environmental variation. We suggest that focusing on environmental heterogeneity rather than branching patterns will yield the greatest understanding of the drivers of stream community structure and the greatest benefits for management and restoration of stream communities.},

	abstract = {Increasing demand for freshwater during the last century has so severely degraded many wetland ecosystems that they are some of the most seriously impacted environments in the world. Environmental ﬂows are used as a management tool to restore parts of the hydrological regime altered by human water use, to rehabilitate these wetlands. Research and monitoring to date has focused on understanding ‘ﬂow-ecology’ relationships, without investigating the mechanisms underlying them. We sought to understand how different basal food sources are incorporated into ﬁsh tissue in temporary wetland systems. This study provides a necessary ﬁrst step toward the development of mechanistic research that investigates the effects of variation in fatty acids (FA) within the food and prey base on top predators. We added different sources of fatty acids to wetland mesocosms by adding extra food sources including redgum leachate to increase planktonic bacteria populations, cyanobacteria, green algae and bioﬁlm matrix to observe how they were incorporated into secondary consumers. Wetland soil and water was added to replicate mesocosms, left for 28 days to produce zooplankton and then Western carp gudgeons added. There was a clear shift in the invertebrate assemblage structure following the introduction of the gudgeons. There was also a clear difference in assemblage structure and nutritional value between benthic and planktonic invertebrates. However, the addition of extra food sources did not generate differing FA proﬁles between treatments in the substratum fractions, invertebrates or ﬁsh after 14 days. We suggest that food sources generated within the mesocosms themselves may have outweighed any treatment effects. Using ﬂooded wetland mesocosms potentially would have provided more realistic knowledge of the food web mechanisms of wetland inundation rather than feeding zooplankton fed speciﬁc primary food sources to ﬁsh. However, future experiments attempting to identify the mechanisms of the transfer of basal food sources in wetlands to secondary consumers may wish to directly feed ﬁsh primary consumers raised on speciﬁc basal food sources.},

	abstract = {Understanding energy flow through ecosystems and among sub-habitats is critical for understanding patterns of biodiversity and ecosystem function. It can also be of considerable applied interest in situations where managing for connectivity among habitats is important for restoring degraded ecosystems. Here, we describe patterns of basal resource quality and identify primary basal energy sources in three habitats—river channels, anabranches and wetlands—of a lowland river floodplain in the Murray River catchment, Australia during a period of disconnected surface flow. We used a combination of stable isotope and fatty acid analyses to determine which basal resources were assimilated by the backswimmer Anisops thienemanni and the Eastern mosquitofish Gambusia holbrooki and assessed food quality across the three habitats. Seston was a primary basal resource for both animals in all three habitats, but was of higher quality within floodplain habitats than in the river channel. Although floodplain seston contained higher concentrations of essential fatty acids, fatty acid profiles of animals from different habitats remained similar. Our research suggests that inundation of floodplains and subsequent reconnection to the river could be valuable to afford riverine animals the opportunity to access high quality resources, but highlights a need to quantitatively assess the transfer of essential fatty acids between trophic levels to determine how much riverine animals are in fact limited by poorer quality food resources. We demonstrate the importance of estimating the quality of organic matter fluxes into food webs, and the potential role of targeted environmental flows to re-establish high quality energy pathways in riverine ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Partial migration strategies, in which some individuals migrate but others do not, are widely observed in populations of migratory animals. Such patterns could arise via variation in migratory behaviors made by individual animals, via genetic variation in migratory predisposition, or simply by variation in migration opportunities mediated by environmental conditions. Here we use spatiotemporal variation in partial migration across populations of an amphidromous Hawaiian goby to test whether stream or ocean conditions favor completing its life cycle entirely within freshwater streams rather than undergoing an oceanic larval migration. Across 35 watersheds, microchemical analysis of otoliths revealed that most adult Awaous stamineus were freshwater residents (62\% of n = 316 in 2009, 83\% of n = 274 in 2011), but we found considerable variation among watersheds. We then tested the hypothesis that the prevalence of freshwater residency increases with the stability of stream flows and decreases with the availability of dispersal pathways arising from ocean hydrodynamics. We found that streams with low variation of daily discharge were home to a higher incidence of freshwater residents in each survey year. The magnitude of the shift in freshwater residency between survey years was positively associated with predicted interannual variability in the success of larval settlement in streams on each island based on passive drift in ocean currents. We built on these findings by developing a theoretical model of goby life history to further evaluate whether mediation of migration outcomes by stream and ocean hydrodynamics could be sufficient to explain the range of partial migration frequency observed across populations. The model illustrates that the proportion of larvae entering the ocean and differential survival of freshwater-resident versus ocean-going larvae are plausible mechanisms for range-wide shifts in migration strategies. Thus, we propose that hydrologic variation in both ocean and stream environments contributes to spatiotemporal variation in the prevalence of migration phenotypes in A. stamineus. Our empirical and theoretical results suggest that the capacity for partial migration could enhance the persistence of metapopulations of diadromous fish when confronted with variable ocean and stream conditions.},
